# Tap

Tap for my personal applications:

- [Reedsy for Mac](https://github.com/aubreypwd/reedsy-mac/), `reedsy-mac`

## How do I install these formulae?

```bash
brew tap aubreypwd/homebrew-cask
brew update
brew cask install <formula>
```

## Development

```
brew tap aubreypwd/homebrew-cask git@github.com:aubreypwd/homebrew-cask.git
```

Then browse to `/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/aubreypwd/homebrew-cask` and contribute upstream.
